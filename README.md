# javascript_To-Do-List
In this To Do List we can add our task list and mark that task as competed or incomplete. we can write the new task in the input box and click on the "Add" button then the new task will be added to the list. We can click on the task name to mark it as completed or incomplete task. We will add a close icon to delete the particular task from the To Do list. In this JavaScript project we are using Local Storage that will store the task list in our web browser, so that if you close and restart the browser then also it will display your saved To-Do List
